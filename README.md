# Twitter-Crawler

This project helps crawling Twitter and save the data in csv files. It used GotOldTweet3 python library which can retrive old tweets and thereby get over 
the date restriction of Tweepy.

The program creates a new file for each date range selected. The current code version has date range = 1; so it creates a new file for each day. 
There is another file "Consolidated.py" which will consolidate all the individual csv files into one file.

Thanks
